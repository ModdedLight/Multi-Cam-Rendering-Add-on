# Multi-Cam-Rendering-Add-on
Rendering tool for Blender

While creating a skybox for a Source mod, I found the process of changing the active camera, rendering, and saving images from six different cameras to be a bit stressful. To streamline this, I created an add-on that renders one image per camera with a single click. Each rendered PNG is automatically named after the camera it was taken from, making the workflow much smoother.

You can select the image format in the output properties of your scene.
